## Welcome to KorGE

Korge is a multiplatform game development toolset.

Getting started with KorGE is really simple.

### Quickstart

1. Install the KorGE **IntelliJ plugin** and create a project with the project wizard (check [here](https://youtu.be/qw5ja1fnbSo) for a video description)

2. Either

    - Download the **HelloWorld** KorGE project from [here](https://github.com/korlibs/korge-hello-world/archive/master.zip), or 
    - Clone the **HelloWorld** Repository via `git clone https://github.com/korlibs/korge-hello-world`

After downloading or cloning, open it in IntelliJ as a project

### Check some samples

1. Download the **Samples** KorGE project from [here](https://github.com/korlibs/korge-samples/archive/master.zip)

2. Clone the **HelloWorld** Repository via `git clone https://github.com/korlibs/korge-samples.git`

After downloading or cloning, open it in IntelliJ as a project


### Learning KorGE

1. Take your [first steps](firststeps) learning to create a sample game with basic shapes.

2. Then build a more complex and realistic game with a [step-by-step tutorial to build a 2048 game](firstgame).

3. Finally, [deploy it in one of our supported platforms](/korge/deployment).


From there you can get a deep look to the [reference documentation](/korge/reference),
and have a look at creating your own KorGE [bundles](/features/bundles) to see how others have built
games and learn from them.
