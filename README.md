# docs.korge.org
This is the offical documentation of the framework Korlibs.
Contributions in every way are welcome.

To launch the documentation locally on your PC there are 2 options:


## Option 1: [Install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Then execute `jekyll s`

## Option 2: [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Then execute `./jekyll.sh` on linux or `jekyll2.bat` on Windows

## Advices

To simplify image illustration and editing. I recommend:

* Snagit - Configured with `cmd+shift+2` on MacOS
  * After creating and editing, you can press `cmd+c` to copy and use the Paste Images into Markdown plugin to create an image
* Webstorm
  * [Paste Images into Markdown Webstorm plugin](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/pasteimages)
